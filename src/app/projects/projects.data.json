        "description_2":"The core section of IOP App focuses on the experiences and reactions that users have while using Samsung products in their everyday life. These are a new and effective kind of reviews that give a clear feedback about products in a more personal way using also photos and videos and overcoming the banal description of the specs that people can find everywhere. As the user approach the store, a beacon triggers IOP app to open camera and, with augmented reality, let him see the every product in the color of the selected mood. At this moment, the customer can point a specific product and feel all the related experiences of the Products section of IOP App about it.",

This section has the power to create a net of contacts and real interactions between people of IOP, inviting them to live some experience where they have the possibility to try for real Samsung products and, building a solid relation with the brand, be invited to fill the Pure and Product sections with the experiences that the Event section proposes."

This app will be the core of a huge campaign that wants to give the impression that Nike owns the world during Olympic Games’ period.",
